# ImOS
A 32-bit operating system implemented fully in assembly and C languages

# Aims:
## learn how an OS services by touching everything from scratch
It is a 32-bit protected mode OS enabling BIOS calls by switching into real mode
## implementation of USB 3.0 support via xHCI controller
The goal was primarily to support usb HIDs (mouse and keyboard), but finally I fell in love with the whole xHCI implementation.
 Thanks to Ben Lunt
## SVGA double buffering implementation for later implementation of custom MoviePlayer based on it
Basically it has always been and still is my primarily goal to learn and start deep thinking of the OS working principles. 
I would love to implement fast, assembly-optimized graphic applications (from kernel, driver, and graphic adapter point of view). No doubt the best resource is "zen of assembly" and "zen of graphic" by M. Abrash
