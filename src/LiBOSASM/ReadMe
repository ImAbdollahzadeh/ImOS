	LiBOSASM: a 32-bit-only x86 assembler written in C by Iman Abdollahzadeh

	Syntax:
		registers:
			eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esp, ebp, esi, edi
			ax, cx, bx, dx, sp, bp, so, di
			al, cl, dl, bl, ah, ch, dh, bh
			cs, ds, es, fs, gs, ss, eflags, flags

		memory modes:
			mov eax, DWORD[0xFFFFFFFF]
			mov eax, DWORD[address]
			mov eax, DWORD[esp]
			mov sp,  WORD[0xFFFFFFFF]
			mov dh,  BYTE[0xFFFFFFFF]		
			add BYTE[address], 0x58
		
			this is wrong -> mov eax, DWORD [address]. There should be no space between memory size and brakets
		writing .asm files:
			all files must be started with [LiBOSASM 32-bit]
			all files must have only one origin as [ORIGIN 0x38EF501A]
			.text and .data sections must be given as [SECTION .CODE] and [SECTION .DATA], respectively
			there is no uninitialized section. There is no more sections
			all labels MUST be ended with ':' character like FIRST_LABEL:
			the only character reserved for the assembler and should not be used in any case is '!'
		
		data definitions in SECTION .DATA:
			all data definitions include their size
			they must be ended with character ':'
			the data definition must be done in one line, therefore breaking the line by enter, is invalid
			section .DATA must be declared ALWAYS at the end of the file after section .CODE
			they obey the naming as for the labels (see below)
			data types are:
				db to define 1 to n bytes as string
				dw to define 1 WORD data
				dd to define 1 DWORD data
				dq to define 1 QWORD data
				dX (and not dx to be confused with dx register) to define 1 XMMWORD data

			all numeric data must be goven in hexadecimal form like 0xFF
			to define a string of characters use '' and not ""
			all special characters such as \n and \t must be defined inside '' for the string

			example:
				[SECTION .DATA]
				string_to_be_printed: db 'LiBOS assembler version 0.00\n\0'
				_@@__rgb_black_mask: dw 0x0000
				simd_operation_data: dX 0xFFFFFFFF000000001111111122222222

		several label examples:
			__label@@__assembler12F0:
			loop:
			end_of_subroutine_v@u32@u32p@function:
	
		upper/lower case:
			all instructions include lower case mnemonics
			all memory sizes are upper case
			all numbers are in hexadecimal with 0x initiation like 0xFFAABBC7
			to define a simd 128-bit data from integer values use: 0xAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDD
			all addresses should be 32-bits hexadecimal numbers
			all numbers should be 32-bits hexadecimal like 0x00000042 instead of only 0x42
			all numbers for 16-bit instructions are hexadecimal 16-bits like 'mov cx, 0x45FA'
			all numbers for 8-bit instructions are hexadecimal 8-bits like 'mov cl, 0x4B'

		defining numeric tokens:
			in order to mark two or more positions in the entire file for further analysis,
			there is the machanism called 'numeric token'. For instance, we have a subroutine somewhere.
			We would like to know, during the runtime, the sizeof this particular subroutine.
			The way to do it is via numeroc token definition.

			Example:
				...
				_subroutine_1:
					$subroutine_1_start
						push ebp
						mov ebp, esp
						mov eax, DWORD[some_address]
						xor edi, edi					
						add eax, edi
						mov esp, ebp
						pop ebp
						ret
					$subroutine_1_end

				_subroutine_2
					...
 
				Therefore the quantity ($subroutine_1_start - $subroutine_1_end) gives the size of _subroutine_1.
			The way to define a proper numeric token is to start with a '$' character and follow up with any other
			characters, numbers expcep '!' character.

			Note that defining two or more similar numeric tokens leads to the whole program crash.
			Note that you should not finish your numeric token with a ':' character, otherwise LiBOSASSEMBLER 
			takes it into account as a label.
 
		jumps:
			there are two types of jumps and for each, there are two supported modes.
			the first type of jump is normal far jump to anywhere
			the second type is conditional jumps based on values in EFLAGS register.
			for each jump type explained above, the suppoted modew can be either direct immediate-32-bit or indirect addressing
			including labels.

			Example:
				...
				jmp 0xFFFFDDAA
				jmp DWORD[_a_label:]
				jmp DWORD[eax+0xFFFFAA12]
				jmp DWORD[esp]				
				...
 				jne 0xFFAA2345
				je  DWORD[mem]
				jnz ...
				jz  ...
				...		

		ALL IN ALL, THE NUMBERING, ADDRESSING, AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE 'STRONGLY TYPED'
